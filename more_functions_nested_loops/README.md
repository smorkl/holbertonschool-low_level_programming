C - More functions, more nested loops
  	0-isupper.c
		use if and I put the condition that if it is uppercase to return 1 and else to return 0
	1-isdigit.c
		I use if to put a condition that tells me if c is a number between 0 or 9 and returns 1 and that to return 0
	2-mul.c
		multiply two numbers using *, putting a variable called result and returning the result
	3-print_numbers.c
		I used the while loop to generate the numbers from 0 to 9 and printed them with putchar
